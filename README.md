# Walk-in Clinics App

This application addresses the need for people to know waiting times at nearby walk-in clinics
without having to leave their home. It also allows users to know the services offered by nearby
walk-in clinics and allow them to check-in/book appointments at the clinic of their choice.

The android application was developed by a team of 4 people for SEG2105.

Developed using: AndroidStudio (Java), Firebase realtime database.
